## Motivation
This summer, I was given the opportunity to participate in AT&T's Big Data Hackathon in San Francisco. The hackathon's aim is simple: utilize data in a way that could bring us one step closer to realizing the [#SmartCities Initiative](http://about.att.com/sites/internet-of-things/smart_cities). 

Smart Cities is a movement that seeks to make our cities more connected. Human beings generate [mind-boggling amounts of data](http://www.vcloudnews.com/every-day-big-data-statistics-2-5-quintillion-bytes-of-data-created-daily/), just by existing in today's world. We can leverage this data to create a framework that helps cities [become cleaner, safer, and more connected to their citizens.](http://about.att.com/sites/internet-of-things/smart_cities) The end result is a city that has the infrastructure and transparency to enrich the lives of everyone that lives and works there. 

Growing up in various parts of Silicon Valley, I've lived through moments of extraordinary change in the region's economic output and health. From the dot-com boom that brought my family here to the economic downturn that nearly halved the value of homes in the area, I've grown up steeped in a housing market that has been characterized by steep ups and downs. 

I thought it'd be cool to visualize these trends by pulling data from [DATA.GOV](https://www.data.gov), which has a treasure trove of information about various cities. It has census information, crime data, the amount of bicycle racks on every corner, and much  more. I used CitySDK, which can be found on opendata, and I highly recommend [checking it out](https://uscensusbureau.github.io/citysdk/) for your own projects! 

There are multiple factors that affect the valuation of a home, including local school APIs, crime rates, walkability scores, and proximity to industry. We can use census data to track home valuation growth and decline and gain insight into how well the supply of homes satisfies the demand from buyers. 

## Getting Up and Running


## Screenshots and Use Cases






## Lessons Learned
Moving forward, I want to explore the reasons why families choose the homes they do, and how buying and selling real estate can become more streamlined and efficient. For starters, it seems rather obvious that a family would buy whatever real estate best fits their needs, but why must the home-buyer tolerate the formal process of finding an agent, viewing lots of homes, making lots of offers, and hoping that one goes through. This seems like an area ripe for disruption, especially if we could create tools that understand a buyer's life and can suggest homes that would fit the buyer's mold more accurately. 

Think about the way tird-party cookies work. I could look at a pair of sneakers on Amazon and then get bored and go to Facebook, and I'll still see ads for those sneakers in my Facebook sidebar! It doesn't matter what website I visit. Ad providers can track my information and suggest exactly what I want across multiple domains. 

If a model could understand a buyer's income, asset levels, occupation, and hobbies, it could suggest homes that are affordable and more likely to fit a buyer's needs instantly, solving the problem of finding homes to show a buyer in the first place. This information is not only a) volunteered by most users on a daily basis, but b) one could simply ask the buyer for it in exchange for a painless home-buying approach. 


(Update 12/2016: I'll be interning at [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com) during Summer 2017! I'll be shipping tools that help real estate agents and families buy and sell homes more easily.)

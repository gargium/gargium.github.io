## Overview
AT&T and Heroes on the Water asked Summer '16 interns to explore and develop solutions to problems of scale that HoW was facing. 

(explain what HoW does and their numbers)

Formally, we were told to implement features such as an internal management system to track chapter meetings and donations on the MEAN stack, and porting the features over to the existing HoW website would be taken care of after the internship. 

My team took it one step further.

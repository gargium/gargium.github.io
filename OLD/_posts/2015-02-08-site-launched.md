Finally put together a personal website after it being on my todo list for months. Pretty cool what you can accomplish with 30 minutes of Googling and 15 minutes of coding. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) definitely makes life easier although I'm still exploring it. Looking forward to bigger and better things as far as this website goes!

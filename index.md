# About Me

Majoring in Computer Science at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu). 

Incoming Associate Product Manager Intern at Redfin. Formerly PM and SWE at [AT&T](https://www.att.com). 

I enjoy shipping great products that have the potential to better people's lives. I'm interested in helping organizations catalyze innovation through venture capital or data-driven product management.
